## Build and run

You need a copy of IntelÂ® Open Image Denoise (IOID). Grab a package from their 
[download section](https://www.openimagedenoise.org/downloads.html). Unpack this 
somewhere. We refer to this below as the OIDN location.

Export the OIDN location for the build to find the headers & libraries. For example:

```
export OIDN_DIR=$HOME/Downloads/oidn-1.3.0.x86_64.linux/
```


```
cargo run --release ./scene/cornell/scene.yaml ./scene/cornell/render_settings.yaml
```

During rendering, press and hold D for denoise and N for normals.
